        <p>Need a web host? <em>Host yo self!</em> Use this page to host a website or a file directly from your computer / phone / smartwatch / toaster!</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Click here for FAQ.</summary>
            <h2 id=" faq">FAQ</h2>
            <p><strong>How do I start web hosting?</strong> You will need to setup port forwarding, a dynamic DNS, name
                registration, MySQL, PHP, Apache and take a online course in Javascript. </p>
            <p>Just <em>kidding</em>! You don't need any of that crap. Just drag and drop a folder, or select a file.
                That's literally it. Now you can host a website from your laptop or your phone or your smartwatch or
                your toaster.</p>
            <p><strong>How is this possible?</strong> When the server you point at gets a request for a webpage, the
                server turns back and asks <em>you</em> for that content and will use what you provide for the original
                request.</p>
            <p><strong>Seriously, how is this possible?</strong> The relay uses websockets in your browser to process
                GET commands.</p>
            <p><strong>Won't my website disappear when I close my browser?</strong> Yep! There is a command-line tool
                that doesn't require a browser so it can run in the background if you need that. But yes, if your
                computer turns off then your site is down. Welcome to the joys of hosting a site on the internet.</p>
            <p><strong>Won't I have to reload my browser if I change a file?</strong> Yep! Welcome to the joys of
                Javascript.</p>
            <p><strong>Whats the largest file I can host using this?</strong> <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
            <p><strong>Should I use this to host a website?</strong> Dear god yes.</p>
            <p><strong>Does this use AI or blockchain?</strong> Sure, why not. </p>
            <p><strong>What inspired this?</strong> <a href="https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd">websocketd</a>
                which shows the magic of websockets and <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">beaker browser</a> which
                shows the magic of browser hosting.</p>
            <p><strong>What's the point of this?</strong> You can host a website! You can share a file! Anything you
                want, directly from your browser!</p>
